Version with a center "cloud" - good for many people in groups and workshops.

The game parameters depend on the number of people.
Waiting for the html version of the game parameters generator, use these defaults values :

Number of cards per group : 
10

Final need points on the 10th round :
7

Money per group :
7

Maximum stress points per group :
5

Planet collapse :
closest integer below the total amount of money dealt (number of groups x 7) multiplied by 9/10.
=> floor(7*NumberOfGroups*9/10)
